# Confidence in Design

- I feel most confident in organizing the project repository,
- defining the overall system structure, and creating clear documentation to describe the use case and architecture. - -
- Developing the markdown files helped reinforce how to communicate technical designs in a structured and reproducible way.
- I am also confident in designing the data flow and mapping cloud services to specific roles within the architecture.

## Areas of Uncertainty

- I feel less confident in deploying and managing cloud resources in a live environment, particularly within Azure, hovewer, I rather like Azure more then Google Cloud,
- While I understand the conceptual role of services such as Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and Azure SQL Database, implementing and configuring these services in practice would require additional hands-on experience.
- I am less confident in working directly with Azure Blob Storage. Additional hands-on experience with uploading, accessing, and managing blobs would help strengthen my understanding.

- I am least confident in working with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, as my exposure to Oracle services has been more limited compared to Azure. This project helped clarify architectural concepts across cloud platforms, but further practice would be needed to feel comfortable deploying solutions in Oracle.
